# 🔧 IoT-Based Machine Monitoring System for Drilling Machine

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an **IoT-based retrofitting solution** for a conventional drilling machine to enable real-time monitoring of machine health parameters such as **temperature, vibration, and position**.
The system helps in **predictive maintenance, fault detection, and reducing machine downtime** without modifying the mechanical structure.
